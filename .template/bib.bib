abstract = {Enterprise Architecture (EA) plays a dominant role in today's organizations by providing a holistic view of business, information, systems, and technology. Unfortunately, designing an EA is a very challenging and sophisticated task such that 40% of EA projects usually fail mainly due to either an inconsistent evaluation process or ignoring the planning aspect of evaluation. In this paper, we present a complete survey of various published papers on recent advancements in EA evaluation techniques and discuss the Pros and Cons of each of which. We finally present a set of novel evaluation criteria as well as a Cross-layer Evaluation (CLE) approach, which can consider all the EA layers from the strategy and business architecture to technology architecture. The proposed approach offers tremendous insights into EA and can be easily incorporated into every enterprise with a moderate cost.},

Enterprise Architecture (EA) can be levergaed to structure and align transformation and consequently manage this complexity. Hence, EA has the potential to play a major role in the current times of digital transformation by enabling organizations to effectively manage and transform their architectures. However, to do so the discipline EA itslef needs to evolve and adapt to changing conditions. This research investigates based on a Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) perspective, how EA can be practiced effectively to support digital transformation.},

abstract = {In the today's market, there is a wide range of failed IT projects in specialized small and medium-sized companies because of poor control in the gap between the business and its vision. In other words, acquired goods are not being sold, a scenario which is very common in tourism retail companies. These companies buy a number of travel packages from big companies and due to lack of demand for these packages, they expire, becoming an expense, rather than an investment. To solve this problem, we propose to detect the problems that limit a company by re-engineering the processes, enabling the implementation of a business architecture based on sentimental analysis, allowing small and medium-sized tourism enterprises (SMEs) to make better decisions and analyze the information that most possess, without knowing how to exploit it. In addition, a case study was applied using a real company, comparing data before and after using the proposed model in order to validate feasibility of the applied model.},

abstract = {Enterprise architecture (EA) is an approach for managing all components of enterprise and relationships among them. By implementing EA, the organization will be threatened from different aspects. We used failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) which is a powerful tool for evaluating EA risks. In traditional FMEA, risk priority number (RPN), has been calculated by multiplication of three criteria, severity, occurrence and detection. Because of some drawbacks of the traditional FMEA, this paper—instead of calculating RPN—prioritizes EA risk factors with fuzzy VIKOR. VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje in Serbian, means Multi-criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution) is a multiple attribute decision making technique which aims to rank EA risk factors with respect to the criteria. As regards using linguistic variables, fuzzy approach is used to allow experts to use linguistic variables. The proposed method is used for evaluating twenty EA risk factors, which integrates knowledge and experience acquired from professional experts.},

abstract = {Today&#x2019;s business world is continuously challenged by unexpected disruptive events, which are increasing in their frequency and effects. As a consequence, it is plausible to foresee future scenarios in which turbulence and instability are no longer considered as episodic crises, but rather somewhat the &#x201C;norm&#x201D; or the default status. This trend naturally raises the question of how organizations can strive and even gain in such disruptive environments, and which characteristics are required for combating disruptions. Resilience and antifragility are two emerging approaches to handle disruptions. Through a literature review, this paper identifies several strategies that contribute to business ecosystem&#x2019;s resilience or antifragility. Furthermore, it is also shown that contributions from a number of disciplinary areas, including Collaborative Networks, Systems Thinking, Thermodynamics, Management science, and ICT, can provide complementary views and support. A set of promising examples of applications of the discussed approaches are presented and briefly analyzed. Finally, a number of open questions and directions for further research are presented.},

In fact, antifragile software design is becoming a research issue in the software engineering community. We got inspired by the Agile Manifesto which set an important reference point to the software community, addressing primarily innovation in the software development process. We propose a similar approach to Antifragility, namely we would like to define the principles ruling the building up of software systems which exploit faults and errors to become better and stronger. This Manifesto does not want to be a fixed and complete set of principles. It is an open contribution to the discussion which needs to be improved and re-elaborated. All rights related to the Manifesto are free, open and belong to the community. This work represents our suggestions urging the community to start elaborating antifragile principles to lead their implementation in real organizations.},

Make tough decisions about which processes you must execute well, then implement the IT systems needed to digitize those processes. Citing numerous companies worldwide, the authors show how constructing the right enterprise architecture enhances profitability and time to market, improves strategy execution, and even lowers IT costs. Though clear, engaging explanation, they demonstrate how to define your operating model—your vision of how your firm will survive and grow—and implement it through your enterprise architecture. Their counterintuitive but vital message: when it comes to executing your strategy, your enterprise architecture may matter far more than your strategy itself.},

abstract = {Digital transformation requires an altogether new institutional logic and effective response at a requisite organizational level. Sensing and seizing fleeting market opportunities and reconfiguring the business in line with the shifting value proposition requires increasingly specialized resources, more dynamic capabilities, and in-built resilience in the face of change. While Enterprise Architecture (EA) has been suggested to facilitate enterprise transformation, the focus has traditionally been on process standardization and integration rather than on continuous adaptation to the changing business and technological landscape. For EA to have a desired impact, more adaptive conceptualizations of EA that address the requirements of the new digital environment are called for. In this conceptual paper, we explore the implications of digital transformation on enterprise architecture. In particular, we note that existing approaches to EA address integration and coherence within a single organization but typically fall short in the face of complexities pertaining to digital ecosystems. We suggest a vertical typology of organizational capabilities and postulate that today's digital environment increasingly requires adaptive capabilities that transcend the traditional notion of dynamic capabilities. We then investigate how EA can help build flexibility and resilience in the organization.},
