## Operating Models or EA ##

| Business Process integration | Low             | Low         | High         | High        |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Standardization              | Low             | High        | Low          | High        |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
|                              | Diversification | Replication | Coordination | Unification |


. . .

Are these operating models still suitable today?

::: notes

* Diversification: economies of scale w/ independence
* Replication: standard infrastructure w/ global efficiency
* Coordination: sharing the data
* Unification: standard process reinforcement w/ global data access

::: 


## Embracing the change ##

* Today's environment: *change* is faster than response

. . .

* Hard to maintain competitive advantage

. . .

* What can companies do?
  * develop *temporary* advantages
  * seize opportunities & reconfigure the organization *on an ongoing basis*
  * cultivate dynamic capabilities

. . .

### Dynamic capabilities
  
  * Moderately dynamic market: analytic routines on existing knowledge
  * High-velocity market: experimental routines on new knowledge

::: notes
* change: discontinuous, unpredictable, environment very complex
* competitive advantage:
  * defensible market solution: 
    * positioning for a particular market position (segmentation, cereal)
    * creating preference, differentiate in a commodity market (gas, airtraverl)
    * commanding a premium (luxury brands)
    * having a unique product

* dynamic capabilities 
    * the distinct skills, processes, procedures, organizational structures, decision rules, and disciplines 
    * which undergird enterprise-level sensing,seizing, and reconfiguring capacities

## A foundation for execution ? ##

![](foundationquestion.png) {width=250px}

## A foundation for execution ? ##

* global competition and co-operation with *networked business ecosystems*
* revolution of IT

. . .

* Need for Enterprise Architecture more than ever to *facilitate the change*
  * Traditional scope: process standardization & integration
  * New scope: continuous adaptation

### Scope of this series of Lectures
  * How can Enterprise Architecture cope with disruption?
  * What capabilities do we need to *thrive on* digital transformation
  * What are the new emerging enterprise models?
  

::: notes
* networked business ecosystems: pull together co-specialized capabilities in a non-linear fashion
* IT revolution
  * unprecedented computing power, infinite virtual space, ubiquitous connectivity
  * potential for effectiveness, increased flexibility, create new business models
* EA
  * manage the vast complexity of business-IT amalgam, 
  * ensure coherent structure, make visible the underlying organizational systems
